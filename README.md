# Weather Simulator in OpenGL

## Project Description
This project is a weather simulator developed using OpenGL, designed to provide a visual representation of various weather effects. The weather data is retrieved from the **openMeteo API**, allowing users to tune and experience different weather conditions through keyboard inputs.

## Effects
The weather simulator includes the following weather effects:

- Rain: Simulates a rain shower with droplets falling from the sky.
- Snow: Generates a snowfall effect, with snowflakes gracefully descending.
- Hail: Emulates a hailstorm, where small icy pellets fall rapidly.
- Fog: Adds a misty atmosphere to the scene, reducing visibility.
- Temperature: Reflects the current temperature based on the openMeteo API data.

## Controls
The simulator provides the following keyboard controls:

- R: Activates or deactivates the rain effect.
- N: Enables or disables the snow effect.
- G: Triggers or stops the hail effect.
- F: Toggles the activation or deactivation of the fog effect.
- +/-: Adjusts the intensity of the fog effect, allowing users to increase or decrease the fog density.
- C/H: Switches between cold and hot weather settings, adjusting the overall temperature simulation.

Please note that the weather conditions and their intensities are dynamically retrieved from the **openMeteo API**, ensuring a realistic representation of current weather data. Users can interactively control and customize the weather effects in real-time using the specified keyboard inputs.

Have a captivating experience as you explore the various weather phenomena brought to life through this interactive weather simulator!
